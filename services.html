    <p>The Fundaci√≥n Real Madrid runs the Club's Historical Heritage Centre, which contains thousands of written, graphical and audio-visual documents, as well as multiple objects: trophies, flags, membership cards, posters and all sorts of relevant items.
 
        The ultimate goal is to create a large documentation centre equipped with the latest technology. A centre that will serve the interests of the Club and also provide a relevant source of information for specialists, students and researchers who wish to access it, as well as for Real Madrid fans and members.
        
        There are currently more than 210,000 objects catalogued, including: trophies, flags, posters, recordings, paintings, medals, slides, photographs, books, press, etc. </p>
